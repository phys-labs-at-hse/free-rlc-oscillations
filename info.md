Inductivity at low frequencies L 1200 = 59.099 mH
1200 and 400 mean number of turns in the coil

L 400  = 5.841 mH at small freqs, under 1 kHz
R L 400 = 3.5 Ohm

free oscillaion frequncy with C1 is 13.0 kHz
L 400  = 6.139 mH at 10 kHz
R L 400 = 8.3 Ohm
L 400  = 6.37 mH at 13 kHz
R L 400 = 12.1 Ohm

Measuring period and the following part on L 400 = 5.841 mH
Time number's are as in manual.
Total resistance of the reostate 466 Ohm

Chose the 5th capacitor
Critical resistance for them is 440 $\pm$ 10 Ohm.

440 * 0.050 = 22
440 * 0.075 = 33 
440 * 0.100 = 44
440 * 0.125 = 55
440 * 0.150 = 66
440 * 0.175 = 77
440 * 0.200 = 88

Spiral (horizontal, i.e. X is for capacitor):
22 Ohm: 0.02 V * (9, 6.6, 4.8, 3.4, 2.4, 1.6)
33 Ohm: 0.01 V * (10.4, 7, 4.5, 2.8, 1.8)
44 Ohm: 0.01 V * (8.2, 4.7, 2.6, 1.4)
55 Ohm: 0.01 V * (7.6, 3.7, 1.7, 0.8)

Frequency is around 1 / (500 us * 5 / 16) = 6.4 kHz \approx 1 / (2 * pi * sqrt(100e-9 * 5.8e-3))
At this frequency: L 400 = 5.97 mH, R 400 = 6.7 Ohm
